\section{System Definition}
\todo{beskrivelse af f√¶lles system system som vi vil lave. Hver gruppe skal ahve deres egen system statement, der definere hvad gruppen konkret arbejder med.}
Based on our problem definition, the related work we have gathered, and our initial analysis, we define \system as follows:

\subsection{Decomposing \system}
\label{sub:decomposingSys}
The project that we are undertaking is rather large.
This leads us to decompose into smaller sub-projects.
This also makes sense with respect to the context that the project is being conducted, namely an educational context where we are supposed to work in one large group divided into smaller sub-groups.
Each sub-group will have its own sub-project which goal is to make a given sub-system, integrate it with the other sub-systems, and write a report to document the process.

The final system, as defined above, should wait what?
We will be dividing the system into four sub-systems.
