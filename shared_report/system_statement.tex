\section{System Definition}
\label{sec:systemDef}
\todo{beskrivelse af f√¶lles system system som vi vil lave. Hver gruppe skal ahve deres egen system statement, der definere hvad gruppen konkret arbejder med.}
Based on our problem definition, the related work we have gathered, and our initial analysis, we define \system as follows:

\sharedInput{system_definition}











\subsection{Decomposing \system}
\label{sub:decomposingSys}
The project that we are undertaking is rather large.
This leads us to decompose into smaller sub-projects.
This also makes sense with respect to the context that the project is being conducted, namely an educational context where we are supposed to work in one large group divided into smaller sub-groups.
Each sub-group will have its own sub-project which goal is to make a given sub-system, integrate it with the other sub-systems, and write a report to document the process.

The final system, as defined above, should enable PBL in Moodle.
We will divide the system into sub-systems in accordance with the core principles of Aalborg PBL as defined in Section \ref{sub:aaupbl}.
The sub-systems that \system is divided into are:
Project organization,
Participant direction,
Team-based approach, and
Collaboration and feedback.
It should be noted that only four of the six core principles have a corresponding sub-system.
The reason for this is that ensuring problem orientation and integration of theory and practice in a project is close to impossible to do i an information system.
Ensuring such principles can, however, be aided by allowing the supervisor of a group to give feedback to to the group about such matters, provided that the supervisor can help ensure these principles.
The four sub-systems are described in the following sections.

\subsubsection{Project organization}
The students can plan the course of their projects themselves.
This sub-system is responsible for allowing students to make a schedule of a project and assign tasks to students.
A student that is participating in several projects concurrently should be able to get an collective overview of his schedule.
This also corresponds to the request made by ELSA to allow sharing of data described in Section \ref{sub:elsaInterview}, along with the planning request made by MPBL department in Section~\ref{sub:mpblInterview}.

\subsubsection{Participant direction}
During a project, them participants must be able to communicate and thereby direct the course of their project.
The communication must be persistent, such that the participants can use their communication as documentation should it be needed.
The MPBL department describes in the interview we had with them that they will like to have better collaboration between students in Moodle.
This is a key objective of this sub-system.

\subsubsection{Team-based approach}
At a given project there will be associated a team of students.
Only the students associated with a project should be allowed to contribute directly.
This sub-system should consider the request for overview of data made by ELSA
Although not changing the way courses are shown, the overview of a students or supervisors projects must allow for easy navigation.
The nearness request made by the MPBL department should also be satisfied in this sub-system by giving participants of a project a virtual meeting place.

\subsubsection{Collaboration and feedback}
The participants must be able to communicate and receive feedback from their supervisor.
Students should be able to give feedback to projects, provided that the participants of the project allows it.
As with the Participant direction sub-system, this sub-system should cover the MBPL departments request for collaboration.
