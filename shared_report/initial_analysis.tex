\section{Initial Analysis}
\label{sec:initialAnalysis}
To determine how to improve Moodle to support MPBL we conducted two informal discussions with the ELSA department\cite{elsa}\todo{Hvis dette er det første sted elsa bliver nævnt så skal forkortelsen skrives ud, dette gælder også for mpbl} and the MPBL department\cite{mpbl}. This section will acount for the results of the descussion and based on that how we decides to solve the problem explained in conceptual terms. A central discussion topic is introducing project groups\ref{} \todo{ref til der hvor der står noget om gruppearbejde, det står længere oppe i introen.} into Moodle and how they are to be used.     

\subsection{Discussion with expert users}  
\label{sub:expertUsers} 
We conductet a meeting with the two departments mentioned below. On both meeting we discussed which improvements we could make to Moodle in regards to PBL.  

\subsubsection{ELSA}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Type: Informal meeting
	\item Participants:Lillian Buus, Marie Glasemann, Mads Peter Bach, and the E-Learning group \todo{ikke sikket mads deltog i dette møde.} \todo{hvordan laver man kilder på personer?}
	\item Date: 06-02-12
\end{itemize}
ELSA are responsiable for tecnical, organisational, and pedagogical support of Moodle\cite{elsa} and the actual development on moodle are outsourced to the different IT departments on the university. ELSA recive all feature requests and they are responsiable for providing support to the departments of the university, therefore they have keen knowlage about the problems and shortcommings of Moodle. We are only interested improvement Moodle in regarding to PBL, therefore, we have chosen four subject that we deem are relevant to this project:

\paragraph{Automation of input data} When courses are created in Moodle it requireres manual work. This is primaryly done by the administrative personal and the lectures. ELSA wishes that this could be generated automatically based on central data, new features such as project groups should also be generated automatically.     
\paragraph{Maintenance of data} Courses are, as mentioned above, maintained by the administrative personal and the lectures, likewise should group room be maintainable by the students. 
\paragraph{Overview of data} When a person is enrolled to several courses, the task of finding and entering the course page becomes  difficult. ELSA wishes that a new system which renders a greater overview and ease the task of find the wanted item. This problem could also occure if a person is a member of several project groups.
\paragraph{Sharing of data} The ability to share files and relevant material is a central concern when engaged in project group work. ELSA furetheremore explain that there exist a wish have more modular tools that are able to interact and share data. 


\subsubsection{MPBL}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Type: Informal meeting
	\item Participants:Jette Egelund Holdgaard,y,z, and the E-Learning group
	\item Date: 08-02-12
\end{itemize}

In the preliminary phase of working with Electronic-learning (E-learning) it is important for us to ensure that we are in fact working with problems that are relevant in the E-learning and Problem Based Learning (PBL) fields of study, as we are aiming at improving the overall way that the chosen E-learning environment at Aalborg University (AAU), namely Moodle, supports PBL. Because AAU is renowned for its implementation of PBL, we do not have to look very far to find some of the leading experts in this field.

In the initial phase of this project we conducted two interviews with xxx from ELSA\cite{x} and yyy from MPBL.

After interviews with the management team of Moodle at AAU (ELSA) and the PBL section of the institute of planning at AAU, it has become clear to us that Moodle in its current implementation only supports PBL vaguely, if it supports it all. The institute of planning, who teaches PBL through Internet classes based on Moodle, has the problem that the platform they use in their PBL-education does not support PBL, which is the thing they are trying to teach others how to implement. The institute of planning is especially concerned with the lack of an environment in which their Internet-students could connect as a group, because the division of students into groups is one of the fundamental ideas of PBL(KILDE!?!). After interviewing these experts, we interviewed some of the students of AAU, in order to try to understand their use of Moodle, and how to make it a better experience. They told the same story; the lack of group rooms or other places to meet and work together is a pressing concern of most of the students of the faculties of social sciences and the faculty of humanities. Based on these discoveries we have come to the conclusion that it would be useful to have online group rooms, to accommodate the needs of students without available group rooms. This will make it easier to switch between different rooms each day and work together, even if the collaborators of the project are not able to meet physically.
In order to create the group rooms we discovered the following four feasible goals within our limited time-scope:
A virtual blackboard able to save drawings
An easy to use timeline tool to display various deadlines and events
An easy and consistent way for students and supervisors to communicate
Tools allowing the administrative personnel to support all of this new functionality

Because all of this functionality has to be developed on an already existing platform, and not as part of a platform, we have chosen to divide these tasks vertically, as illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:target_group}.
